            Hello everyone, let me introduce myself. I am Dotse Raphael, a student of BYU with a major in Applied Business Management.</p>
            <p>I am a non LDS member who likes the teachings about the Saviour. I have neighbours who fellowship with the Church of Jesus Christ of the Later Saint. I enjoy playing football and practicing on the bass guitar during my leisure. I am currently serving as the Headteacher at Royal Seed Home School and an administrator at the Orphanage.
            <p>I am very happy and grateful to obtain a degree from BYU Idaho. I consider this as the blessings of Heavenly Father for me with the hope that I could at the end, create a website for my alma mater; Royal Seed Home Orphanage where I was raised.</p>  
            <p>I have intended to work harder even as I strive to become a good programmer and developer like everyone else reading this script.</p>
            <P>Although this seemed a new course but, I hope to strive to get over barriers.</P>
        </p>
