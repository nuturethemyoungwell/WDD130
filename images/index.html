    <h2>Raphael Dotse</h2>
    <h2>Graceman</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, let me introduce myself. I am Dotse Raphael, a student of BYU with a major in Applied Business management.</p>
    <p>I am a non LDS member who likes the teachings about the Saviour. I have neighbours who fellowship with the Church of Jesus Christ of the Later Day Saint. I enjoy playing football and practicing on the guitar during my leisure. I am currently serving as the headteacher at the RoyalSeed Home School and an administrator at the Orphanage</p>
    <p>I am very happy and grateful to obtain a degree from BYU Idaho. I consider this as the blessings of Heavenly Father for me with the hope that I could at the end, create a website for my alma mater; Royal Seed Home Orphanage where I was raised.</p>
    <p>I have intended to work harder even as I strive to become a good programmer like eeryone else reading this script.</p>
